# AdultCensusIncomeClassification
This dataset is called Adult Census Income and contains information of adults, and includes information such as age, education, race, sex, work hours per week, native country and income among other things. Target feature is “income”. We will be predicting the class of the people based on their salary, either making <=50k or >50k per year.

I used Python with Jupyter Notebook. Random Forest Classification performs best among other five algorithms.

You can find more detail in project report.
